        <p class="sans desc">However, the OS needs to still have all the code required for all hardware. And, that's
            where drivers come into place. Drivers tell the OS how exactly it can talk to the hardware. An OS usually ships
            with many built-in drivers, for example, mouse driver
            for many different mouse brands, RAM driver, etc. But sometimes, you need to install the proper driver for
            your peripherals; especially if you have a lesser-known product that your OS might not have the required
            drivers built-in.</p>
